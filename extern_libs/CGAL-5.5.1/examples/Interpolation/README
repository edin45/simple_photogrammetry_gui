nn_coordinates_2: shows how to compute 2D natural coordinates 
	given a 2D Delaunay triangulation  and a query point.

nn_coordinates_with_info_2: same as above, using a functor to
        change the default option and store the coordinates
        in the vertices.

nn_coordinates_3: shows how to compute 3D natural coordinates 
	given a 3D Delaunay triangulation  and a query point.

rn_coordinates_2: shows how to compute 2D regular (natural) coordinates 
	given a 2D Regular triangulation  and a (weighted) query point.

linear_interpolation_2: interpolates a linear function using the 
	linear_interpolation function and 2D natural neighbor coordinates.

sibson_interpolation_2: interpolates a spherical function using the 
	sibson_gradient_fitting and sibson_c1_interpolation function with 
	2D natural neighbor coordinates.

surface_neighbor_coordinates_3: shows how to compute natural neighbor 
	coordinates on surfaces. Example of the sphere.

interpolation_2: this example allows to numerically compare the error 
	committed by the different interpolation function when interpolating 
	a predefined function on random points.
