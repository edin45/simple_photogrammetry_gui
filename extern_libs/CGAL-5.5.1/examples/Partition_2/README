examples/Partition_2/y_monotone_partition_2.C
------------------------------------

computes a y-monotone partition of a random polygon and checks that each 
polygon produced is, in fact, y-monotone and that the polygons form a 
partition of the original polygon.

file: examples/Partition_2/approx_convex_partition_2.C
---------------------------------------------

computes an approximately optimal convex partition of a random polygon and 
checks the validity of the partition afterwards.

file: examples/Partition_2/greene_approx_convex_partition_2.C
----------------------------------------------------

computes an approximately optimal convex partition of a random polygon using 
Greene's approximation algorithm and checks the validity of the partition 
afterwards.

file: examples/Partition_2/optimal_convex_partition_2.C
----------------------------------------------

Computes an optimal convex partition of a particular polygon and checks the 
validity of the partition afterwards.

NOTE:  The assertions in these programs are superfluous unless postcondition 
checking has been turned off.
