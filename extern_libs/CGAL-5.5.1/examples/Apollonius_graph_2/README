This is the examples directory for the Apollonius_graph_2 package
There are 4 example programs in this directory. Each one of these is
aimed at describing a different usage for the Apollonius_graph_2
package. In particular:

* ag2_exact_traits.C: a very basic example. It uses an exact number
  type that supports ring operations to achieve robustness.

* ag2_exact_traits_sqrt.C: it shows how to change the method the predicates
  are evaluated. By default the predicates use only the operations +,-,*
  and these are the only operations that is assumed they are exact. In
  this example we show how to change that and how to define the traits
  class so that the operations +,-,*,/,sqrt are used and are assumed
  exact. Again an exact number type is used as the number type.

* ag2_filtered_traits_no_hidden.C: a variation of the first example. The
  filtered traits are now used instead of and exact number type. We also
  show how to use another parameter for the algorithm, namely the one
  that indicates whether hidden weighted points are to be stored or not.

* ag2_hierarchy.C: same as the previous example except the fact that now
  we store the hidden weighted points and on top of that we use a
  hierarchy of Apollonius graphs.
